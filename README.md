# FootballTeamWinnersPrediction
This repository includes analysis and machine learning over a dataset downloaded from the Premier League web page. 
## Contents
1. README.md - this file
2. LICENSE
3. WebScraping - A notebook containing code that helps you download a dataset from the original Premier League page to work with it later. Used libraries Pandas, Beautiful Soup
4. PredictionFootbalTeams.ipynb - A notebook that using a machine learning model called a Random Forest to predict who's going to win each football match in the English Premier League. The processes that take place in this notebook are data set analysis, data cleaning, preparing data for machine learning, testing the accuracy of the machine learning model, and applying it
5. FootbalTeamsVisualization.ipynb - This notebook contains in-depth dataset analytics and answers 5 specific questions using data visualization for clarity. 
## Goals
The main goals I had for this dataset

- Parsing dataset from the premier league site
- Analyze dataset using data visualization
- Data cleaning
- Prepare dataset for machine learning
- Perform machine learning
## Notes
The dataset generated in WebScraping notebook is different from the dataset used in the other two notebooks. WebScraping I created much later myself, so the data are not identical.
